## Visualizing data
The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers," and
the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data.  Visualization deserves an entire
lecture of its own, but we can explore a few features of Python's `matplotlib` library here.  While
there is no official plotting library, `matplotlib` is the _de facto_ standard.  First, we will
import the `pyplot` module from `matplotlib` and use two of its functions to create and display a
[heat map]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#heat-map) of our data:

~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot
image = matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(data)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Heat map representing the `data` variable. Each cell is colored by value along a color gradient
from blue to yellow.](../fig/inflammation-01-imshow.svg)

Blue pixels in this heat map represent low values, while yellow pixels represent high values.  As we
can see, inflammation rises and falls over a 40-day period.  Let's take a look at the average
inflammation over time:

~~~
ave_inflammation = numpy.mean(data, axis=0)
ave_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(ave_inflammation)
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Average Inflammation Over Time](../fig/inflammation-01-average.svg)

Here, we have put the average inflammation per day across all patients in the variable
`ave_inflammation`, then asked `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and display a line graph of those
values.  The result is a roughly linear rise and fall, which is suspicious: we might instead expect
a sharper rise and slower fall.  Let's have a look at two other statistics:

~~~
max_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Maximum Value Along The First Axis](../fig/inflammation-01-maximum.svg)

~~~
min_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

![Minimum Value Along The First Axis](../fig/inflammation-01-minimum.svg)

The maximum value rises and falls smoothly, while the minimum seems to be a step function.  Neither
trend seems particularly likely, so either there's a mistake in our calculations or something is
wrong with our data.  This insight would have been difficult to reach by examining the numbers
themselves without visualization tools.

### Grouping plots
You can group similar plots in a single figure using subplots.
This script below uses a number of new commands. The function `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`
creates a space into which we will place all of our plots. The parameter `figsize`
tells Python how big to make this space. Each subplot is placed into the figure using
its `add_subplot` [method]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#method). The `add_subplot` method takes 3
parameters. The first denotes how many total rows of subplots there are, the second parameter
refers to the total number of subplot columns, and the final parameter denotes which subplot
your variable is referencing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each subplot is stored in a
different variable (`axes1`, `axes2`, `axes3`). Once a subplot is created, the axes can
be titled using the `set_xlabel()` command (or `set_ylabel()`).
Here are our three plots side by side:

~~~
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')

fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

axes1.set_ylabel('average')
axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

axes2.set_ylabel('max')
axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

axes3.set_ylabel('min')
axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()

matplotlib.pyplot.savefig('inflammation.png')
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

![The Previous Plots as Subplots](../fig/inflammation-01-group-plot.svg)

The [call]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function-call) to `loadtxt` reads our data,
and the rest of the program tells the plotting library
how large we want the figure to be,
that we're creating three subplots,
what to draw for each one,
and that we want a tight layout.
(If we leave out that call to `fig.tight_layout()`,
the graphs will actually be squeezed together more closely.)

The call to `savefig` stores the plot as a graphics file. This can be
a convenient way to store your plots for use in other documents, web
pages etc. The graphics format is automatically determined by
Matplotlib from the file name ending we specify; here PNG from
'inflammation.png'. Matplotlib supports many different graphics
formats, including SVG, PDF, and JPEG.

> ## Importing libraries with shortcuts
>
> In this lesson we use the `import matplotlib.pyplot` [syntax]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#syntax)
> to import the `pyplot` module of `matplotlib`. However, shortcuts such as
> `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` are frequently used.
> Importing `pyplot` this way means that after the initial import, rather than writing
> `matplotlib.pyplot.plot(...)`, you can now write `plt.plot(...)`.
> Another common convention is to use the shortcut `import numpy as np` when importing the
> NumPy library. We then can write `np.loadtxt(...)` instead of `numpy.loadtxt(...)`,
> for example.
>
> Some people prefer these shortcuts as it is quicker to type and results in shorter
> lines of code - especially for libraries with long names! You will frequently see
> Python code online using a `pyplot` function with `plt`, or a NumPy function with
> `np`, and it's because they've used this shortcut. It makes no difference which
> approach you choose to take, but you must be consistent as if you use
> `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` then `matplotlib.pyplot.plot(...)` will not work, and
> you must use `plt.plot(...)` instead. Because of this, when working with other people it
> is important you agree on how libraries are imported.
